# Write, Run, Repeat

You won't become a strong programmer with "one secret trick" or "however-many expert tips". No
shortcuts. Just write code, run it, do it again. We'll be creating and executing hundreds of
programs in this course. Let's bang out the first four.

Before you start this exercise, make sure you have watched the lecture first.

If you get stuck during this exercise, reference this walkthrough. Only watch enough of the
walkthrough to get yourself unstuck, then pause the video and pick up the exercise on your own.

Let's get to work.

## 0. Follow my lead.

1. If you already have VSCode open, close it.
2. On your computer's Desktop, create a new folder named `my-first-programs`.
3. Open the `my-first-programs` folder in VSCode
4. Use VSCode to create a file named `greeting.js` inside of `my-first-programs`.
5. Inside of `greeting.js`, write the single line of code `console.log('hello world');`. This will
   cause the program to print `hello world` when you execute it later.
6. Save the `greeting.js` file using the keyboard shortcut `cmd + s` or `ctrl + s`.
7. Open the terminal and enter the command `node greeting.js` to execute your code. **You should see
   `hello world` printed out.**

## 1. Still following?

1. Inside the `my-first-programs` folder, create a new file named `whoami.js`.
2. Inside of `whoami.js` use `console.log` to print out your first name. Don't forget to put
   quotation marks (`'`) around your name and end the line with a semicolon (`;`).
3. Save `whoami.js` and execute it in your terminal using the `node`. **You should see your name
   printed out.**

## 2. I'll follow you.

Start from scratch. Close VSCode if you have it open. Use VSCode to write a program named
`thirsty.js` inside of the `my-first-programs` folder. The program should print out your favorite
cold beverage. Execute `thirsty.js` in your terminal.

## 3. Beginner's luck; show me it again.

That seems suspicious. Write a program named `age.js` that prints out your age. Run it.
